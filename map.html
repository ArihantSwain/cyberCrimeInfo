        <div class="infoText">
          <p> Cyber crime is a very serious problem at the current moment, and as such, many trackers show the flow of cybercrime throughout the world. </p>
          <br>
          <p> This one in specific shows the flow throughout the entire world, with many of the reported threats being named, recorded, and conglomerated. </p>
          <br>
          <p> By clicking the arrow at the bottom you'll be able to see the top targeted countries, and by popping out the embed and checking out the map you'll be able to see
            the most active cyber crimes and malware. </p>
          <br>
          <p> Many of the cybercrimes tracked by this map are the most common ones and by no means represent the totality of all cybercrime in the world; however, it does show a good representation of relative cybercrime based on geographical location. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="infoText">
          <p> Similar to the other map, yet different, this map plots the data in charts, widgets, and maps to visually show many of the important pieces of information.  </p>
          <br>
          <p> It also specifically shows historical data, specific percentages within the world, ports it's hitting, and names various malware such as Trojans, Hoaxs, etc.</p>
          <br>
          <p> By scrolling on the webpage, or navigating throuhg its tabs, it gives the user options to note many different stats and also gives the user an option to find ways to protect themselves from cybercrime by clicking the "Protect Yourself" box in the top right. </p>
          <br>
          <p> This map can also scan based on time period if one scrolls to the bottom of the Statistics tab, and just like the other, may not contain every single cyberthreat.</p>
