    <h1>Stolen House Title</h1>
  </div>    
  
  <div class="story"><p>"Rohina Husseini had no idea someone could steal a house, but the first small clue that the home she owned for nearly a decade was no longer hers was a piece of junk mail that most of us ignore.

  The Springfield mother said she initially tossed the mortgage refinancing offers that began arriving over the summer in the trash, but one detail bugged her: The letters were addressed to another woman. Curious, Husseini said she finally opened one.

  “You bought a new house, congratulations,” read the letter addressed to Masooda Persia Hashimi.

  “I was like, ‘Wow, this doesn’t seem right,’ ” Husseini said. “I don’t know this person at all. She never lived in my house even before [I moved in].”

  In the frantic hours that followed, Husseini discovered the total stranger was now the legal owner of the brick Colonial worth about $525,000 that forms the center of her life with her husband and daughter.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">Husseini, who owns a home health-care business, was the victim of a lesser-known crime alternately called house stealing or deed theft that has seen an uptick in some areas in recent years. Scammers gain control of a deed to a home and then attempt to resell the property or to open a line of credit on it.

  The results can be disastrous. Unsuspecting homeowners can be foreclosed upon or even find strangers living in an unoccupied property or vacation home that has been sold out from under them.

  On probation for fraud, he allegedly swindled again. And a woman lost her home.

  “Oftentimes, the [scammers] will offer a stolen home at an attractive price just below the market rate for an area so it is snapped up quickly,” said Cynthia Blair, the former president of the American Land Title Association. “They get a cash purchaser . . . and [the scammers] are off into the sunset with the money.”

  Thanks to the junk mail tip-off, Husseini avoided one of those worst-case scenarios, but she is living another nightmare: trying to wrest back control of her home. The process can cost rightful owners tens of thousands of dollars and months of court hearings.

  It’s easier than you might think to steal a home.

Husseini’s ordeal began in May. Husseini’s ex-boyfriend walked into a Fairfax City law firm and passed himself off as Husseini, according to Fairfax County police and a lawsuit Husseini has filed. Edress Hamid told the attorney he was headed overseas as part of a military deployment and wanted to transfer control of his home to his wife, Masooda Persia Hashimi, according to the lawsuit.

A woman accompanied Hamid and introduced herself as Hashimi, according to the lawsuit, which names Hamid and Hashimi as defendants. The lawsuit claims the attorney failed to check their identities, a basic step that could have headed off the fraud, before transferring the title to Hashimi. On May 9, Hamid presented the phony deed to the Fairfax County land records office, and Hashimi became the official owner of Husseini’s home, according to the lawsuit. In the weeks that followed, Husseini began receiving the odd junk mail.

Husseini said she immediately jumped into researching what was going on after opening the piece of junk mail in July, a surreal process in which it gradually dawned on her that her home was in someone else’s hands.

Husseini said she called the Fairfax County land records office, which told her that her name was not listed as the owner of her home. Increasingly worried, Husseini headed directly to the Fairfax County courthouse and demanded the actual deed.

She read it with terror and confusion. It said she had granted her property to Hashimi on May 6. She flipped the page and saw the signatures — hers was not her own.“I was shocked,” Husseini said. “I was like, ‘Oh my God, what is this?’ ”

Husseini visited the law firm that had carried out the deed transfer, but she got few answers. She called her mortgage company, which told her they got no notice of the deed transfer. She finally concluded a scam had occurred.

Husseini took her case to the Fairfax County police in August. After an investigation, Hamid was charged in a warrant with forging a deed and passing off a fraudulent record to the land records office in Husseini’s case, police said. Fairfax County police detective Joshua Linebaugh said he is investigating a second case of deed fraud that authorities think is linked to Hamid, although no charges have been placed.

Fairfax County police do not know where Hamid and Hashimi are. Their last known address was in Georgia. Hamid did not respond to requests for comment, and no number could be located for Hashimi, who has not been charged.Husseini hopes to persuade a Fairfax County judge to return her deed by the end of the year.

There are no national figures on house theft, but gentrifying cities such as New York and Philadelphia have reported increases in recent years and have enacted new safeguards. Fraudsters have been scamming longtime homeowners into turning over deeds through scam foreclosure help or forging deeds in neighborhoods where housing values are rapidly increasing.

Blair said the scam is also popular in markets where homes are unoccupied or there are large numbers of vacation homes, because they make easier targets.

Blair said the best safeguard against deed fraud is title insurance that protects against deed problems, while the head of the Fairfax County financial crimes squad recommended vigilance.

“Property owners should be diligent and check on family members who can’t do their own checks, such as the elderly or those not occupying their houses for a period of time,” said 2nd Lt. Jonathan Stern. “Have a good awareness of your property.""<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/she-had-no-idea-her-home-could-be-stolen-then-she-read-her-junk-mail/2019/11/27/13569d0c-065a-11ea-ac12-3325d49eacaa_story.html">-The Washington Post</a></span></p>

  <div class="Header"><h1>Fake Home Deed</h1></div>
        <div class="story"><p>"KANSAS CITY, Mo. (WDAF) — You might want to check the deed to your house if you live in Missouri. Members of a Kansas City family were shocked to learn they were no longer the owner of their home.

“I mean, this was our parents’ home,” said Linda Peak, referring to a house that had been left to her and her siblings after their parents passed away.

This past November, the siblings found a buyer for the $45,000 house. But before the sale could go through, a title company discovered the house had already been sold to someone else.

In October, a man the family had never met filed a deed at the Jackson County Courthouse claiming he had bought the home from them.

“It’s all forged information,” said Peak’s sister Crystal Goff. “He stole our home.”<span id="dots2">...</span><span id="more2">Stealing a home is surprisingly easy in Missouri. It’s such a big problem that several years ago, the Missouri Legislature made the crime a felony.

The name listed on the deed was Ovonjae Tatium, and court records show he’d previously been convicted on theft and drunken driving charges. He also has a warrant out for his arrest for not showing up to court on a DWI charge.

Peak and her sister reported Tatium to Kansas City Police.

“We found out that he had five or six more that he had (bought) all in the same day,” she said.

Peak’s name is misspelled on the deed he filed claiming to own Peak’s and Goff’s house. It’s listed as Park.

“I would never write my name wrong,” she said shaking her head in disbelief.

The Kansas City address on the deed where Tatium claims to live doesn’t exist.

Tatium has also laid claim to another house, which he said was sold to him by Marcellous Adams, according to property records. But Adams told NewsNation affiliate WDAF-TV that he never sold the house to Tatium. Adams said he has owned it for years and uses it as rental property. He has reported the theft to police.

Tatium also claimed to have bought a house from a company called Powered Flight LLC. However, there is no such company registered with the Missouri Secretary of State’s office. The deed listed the company’s address as Harrison, Missouri. There is no town called Harrison in Missouri.

Another home that Tatium has laid claim to stands out as an eyesore on a street of well-tended homes. A neighbor, who didn’t want to be identified, said the home’s last owner died several years ago. Property records show Tatium bought the house last year from Thomas Miles, a man who has been accused of stealing homes multiple times.

WDAF tried repeatedly to find Tatium, visiting every address he has listed and talking to his father, with whom he shares a name. The father said he hadn’t spoken to his son in months but promised to track him down.

Meanwhile, Peak and her sister have hired an attorney to help them prove in court they are the actual owners of their house."

	<div class="Header"><h1>Stolen Deed and House Torn Down</h1></div>
        <div class="story"><p>"ATLANTA — An Atlanta woman wants to warn homeowners after she says someone stole her deed.

She told Channel 2 investigative reporter Ashli Lincoln that she had no idea this had happened until her home was torn down.

Linda Willis says her home in Old Fourth Ward was targeted by strangers because of the prime location of where her home once stood on Ralph McGill Blvd. “This is a historical area, this is why you would buy over here,” Linda Willis said.

Linda Willis said she intended to own the home she bought in 1990 for the rest of her life.

“This is a sad day. After 30 years of paying a mortgage, it has become dangerous to be a senior and own gentrified urban property,” she said. <span id="dots3">...</span><span id="more3"> Back in November, Linda Willis says she arrived to home to find a bulldozer in her front yard tearing down her home.

“I went to the crane operator and said, ‘Who gave you permission to tear down my property?,’” she said.

The operator told her that he had been hired by a company who recently bought the home from a woman named Cencera Willis.

The problem, according to Linda Willis, is that she never put her home up for sale and had no idea who Cencera Willis was.

Lincoln obtained documents from the Fulton County Probate Court showing Cencera Willis filed to be administrator over Linda Willis’ property last year, appointing her deceased mother who just so happened to have the same name as Linda Willis.Real estate attorney Rick Alembik says they are seeing a significant uptick in deed fraud cases, specifically in areas where gentrification is taking place.

“A lot of ways these fraudulent deeds are done, is by people who steal,” Alembik told Lincoln. “The extent in which it’s reported is probably under-reported, but we’re seeing it, we’re seeing more of it.”

Alembik says these scams typically target homes that are paid off.

“It’s easiest when you have a property that’s not incumbent by a mortgage,” he explained.

He says homes that appear abandoned and boarded up also becomes prime targets.

This isn’t the case for Linda Willis, though. Her house was paid off, but was boarded up only because of minor damage from a fire.

“The people who want to buy your property, they don’t just stop at no,” Alembik said.

The attorney also explained that homeowners with common names, like Linda, are also more likely to be targeted.

Lincoln reached out to Cencera Willis, but she wouldn’t comment. Alembik said there are a few ways to help protect your property: set up a doorbell camera, register your home with a fraud registry with your area municipality or take out a reverse mortgage.

“All that we have had to go through, to be able to have a right, to be able to own this little stash of dirt and you’re going to steal my property,” Linda Willis said.

If this happens to you, quickly file a police report and hire a real estate attorney to try to stop the individuals from selling the property to an innocent buyer."

<div class="Header"><h1>Home Title Identity Theft</h1></div>
    <div class="story"><p>"Debi Gotlieb knew something was wrong when she could not find her late father’s home on the county assessor’s webpage. The property was tied up in probate and should have been listed as owned by her father, Jerry Gotlieb, who died in March of 2018 at the age of 84.
“So I put in his address, and it said that it belonged to Zillow. And it showed that it was on the market,” said Gotlieb, who is a real estate agent. “I went to MLS, and it was empty.” All of her father’s possessions were gone. Gotlieb says she drove to the home, called the real estate agent who sold the house to Zillow, and called the police.

“I told the police, ‘I don’t know what happened, but it’s cleaned out, and it’s not in my name.’ And he said, ‘Stay out of the house. It’s not your house,’” said Gotlieb.

“When Debi came to me, the immediate response was how are we going to get this woman’s house back?” said David Degnan, the lawyer Gotlieb hired. Degnan said at that point, time was of the essence because if the house were sold again, it would become more difficult to get it back. <span id="dots4">...</span><span id="more4">“We had to get the property back immediately,” said Degnan.

What Gotlieb did not know at the time was that she had fallen victim to a growing crime called “Deed Fraud.” A simple Google search shows examples of deed fraud taking place all over the country.

“There are so many different stories of how deed fraud occurs,” said Jesi Wolnik, a real estate attorney who studies and works on deed fraud cases. Wolnik says one study from a title company estimated that 90 percent of deed fraud is carried out by family members or friends of the victim. The remaining 10 percent of cases involve criminals who target the victims.

“They’re creating fake documents. They’re recording them,” said Wolnik. “They’re obviously very successful, or they would not be doing this.”

Degnan was able to get Gotlieb’s home back after sending a demand letter to Zillow. A spokesperson for Zillow responded to Arizona’s Family Investigates with the following statement:

“Unfortunately, in 2019, Zillow was made aware of an identity theft related to a home we purchased, so we withdrew the sale and returned the deed to the family.”

Meantime, Scottsdale Police detectives were making headway in figuring out who sold the house and how. In December of 2021, they arrested 30-year-old Vicente Anzu. He was charged with theft, forgery, and identity theft in connection to this case. Anzu is a resident of California. He was somehow able to impersonate a deceased 84-year-old when he presented himself as the owner of the home.

“The criminal had an ID, and it showed that he was born in 1988. My dad bought the house in 1978. Nobody put that together,” said Gotlieb. And the fact that Anzu reportedly signed notarized documents in California helped detectives.

“If he would have signed here, he would have never been caught. But in California, the two notaries took fingerprints. Here we don’t take fingerprints,” said Gotlieb.

Gotlieb managed to get the house back, but her father’s belongings were long gone. According to the Scottsdale Police report into the incident, Anzu, or a co-conspirator, told the real estate agents involved in the sale to get rid of everything in the home.

“All of our family pictures were gone. They tossed them. So it was, it was hard,” said Gotlieb.

“Who really would get rid of every family mementos, medals, certificates, photos? Things that can’t be replaced?” said Wolnik, who just designed a course on deed fraud for real estate agents. She says she submitted the course to the Arizona Department of Real Estate. David Degnan says Debi Gotlieb’s persistence and knowledge of how real estate transactions occur made a big difference in the case.

“I think the luck was that she was also a realtor too. And that she was able to see what’s coming on the market. And when you see your property coming on the market, it’s kind of a scary thing,” said Degnan.

With the incident behind her, Gotlieb says she is still frustrated that nobody along the chain of sale spotted the multiple red flags. “I, today, could get a fake ID and go record a deed and own your house,” said Gotlieb. “You would think that there was something in place to protect an owner. There is nothing in place.” 

Thirty years ago we started creating the largest database of property records in the United States. Today, that database has 6.1 billion property records. We protect your property value and ownership from online threats both foreign and domestic."
